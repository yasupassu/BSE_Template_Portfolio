# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was getting my dc motors to work with the motor driver. I ran into some difficulty with the speed control, but I was able to fix this by rewiring the five volt pin to the five volt port behind the ENA pin. Then I needed to wire the battery in a way to power my Audrino and my motor driver. I was able to get my DC motors to run withe a 6V battery pack. To connect all four motors to one motor driver I had to wire two motors to a port. I was able to get the motors to run, and to prvent the reduction of the speed of the motors, I will have to increase the voltage of the battery.
